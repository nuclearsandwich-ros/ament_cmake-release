Subject: [PATCH] Restore PYTHONPATH bootstrap patch to ament_cmake_core.

This patch was previously applied to the rpm spec template for this package to facilitate finding the ROS installation prefix's python libraries without the ros_bootstrap package since this is a required dependency of ros_bootstrap.

The rosdistro migration tools[1] ought to have preserved these patches however I suspect that behavior is not working correctly when the source and destination distribution are the same.
